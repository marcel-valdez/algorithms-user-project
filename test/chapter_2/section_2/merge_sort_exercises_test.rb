      # 2.2.10 Faster merge. Implement a version of mergesort that copies the
      # second half of the input array to the auxiliary array in -decreasing order- and then
      # does the merge back to the input array. This change allows you to remove
      # the code to test that each of the halves has been exhausted from the inner loop.
      # Warning: The resulting sort is not stable.
      # Note: This test will check that the method produces correct sorts, and will
      #       also compare the execution time against the standard mergesort.

      # 2.2.11 Improvements. Implement the three improvements to mergesort described
      # in the Algorithms 4th ed book. These are:
      # 1) Add a cutoff for small subarrays. Use insertion sort for these.
      # 2) Test whether the array is already in order. if a[mid] <= a[mid+1] don't merge.
      # 3) Avoid the auxiliary copy, by switching arguments in the recursive code.
      #    Two invocations to sort:
      #       1) input array as its parameter, and put the output in the aux array
      #       2) aux array as its parameter, and put sorted output in the input array
      # Note: The test will check 4 things:
      #       1) That the sorted result is correct
      #       2) That it executes at least twice as fast for a sorted array
      #          than the standard merge sort.
      #       3) That it runs faster than the standard merge sort
      #       4) That it runs faster than the implementation of exercise 2.2.10.
