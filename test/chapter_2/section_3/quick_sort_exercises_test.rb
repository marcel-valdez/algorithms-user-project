      #        This implies sampling the first 3 items and choosing the median-sample as
      #        the partitioning key.
      #        Note: The test will only check that it sorts correctly and is faster
      #              than merge sort. We trust you will really implement the technique.

      # TODO: Exercise 2.3.22
      # 2.3.22 Fast 3-way partitioning (J. Bentley and D. McIlroy) Implement an entropy-optimal
      #        sort based on keeping item's with equal keys at both the left and right ends of
      #        the subarray.
      #
      #        Maintain indices p and q such that a[lo..p-1] and a[q+1..hi] are  all equal to a[lo],
      #        and index i such that q[p..i-1] are all less than a[lo], and index j such that a[j+1..q]
      #        are all greater than a[lo].
      #
      #        Before the usual comparisons of a[i] and a[j] with v, add to the inner partitioning
      #        loop code to:
      #       1) swap a[i] with a[p] (and increment p) if it is equal to v.
      #       2) swap a[j] with a[q] (and decrement q) if it is equal to v
      #
      #        After the partitioning loop has terminated:
      #       3) add code to swap the items with equal keys into position.
      #
      #        Note: This code implements the code given in the text, in the sense that it does
      #              extra swaps for keys equal to the partitioning item's key, while the code in
      #              the text does extra swaps for keys that are -not- equal to the partitioning
      #              item's key
      # Assumptions: Assume the input array is shuffled

      # TODO: Exercise 2.3.23
      # 2.3.23 Super quick sort. Add to your implementation from exercise 2.3.22 code to use the
      #        Tukey ninther to compute the partitioning item: choose three sets of three items,
      #        take the median of each, then use the median of the three medians as the partitioning
      #        item. Also, add a cutoff to insertion sort for small subarrays.
